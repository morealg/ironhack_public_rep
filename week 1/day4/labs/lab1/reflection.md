Nowadays it is not possible imagine DevOps without Scrum. Short Sprints push teams to keep testing and automating deployments constantly, which is basically continuous delivery. Daily stand-ups and cross-functional teams get devs and ops talking instead of siloing work. Sprint Reviews bring quick customer feedback, and Retrospectives drive constant process improvements. Overall, it speeds things up, breaks down barriers, and keeps delivery smooth without chaos.
